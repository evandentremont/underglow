This is the arduino code running the underglow on my BMW 323i. Super classy, I know. Looks way better than you'd expect.

It's made from 12 feet of RGB LED strips. You can purchase 15ft of waterproof 5050 RGB 60LED/mfor about $12 via AliExpress. It was attached under the car with Automotive Goop.

The legality is dubious, driving with purple or magenta is technically legal, as is being parked with the police lights. IANAL. 

The circuit is pretty simple. It can be seen here. https://instagram.com/p/6u5cjUk3bW/

 I'll draw and upload it at some point. It's basically three logic level mosfets, one per channel with diodes to keep them seperated, and a voltage divider with 220ohm and 2x220ohm to map 15V to 5V.
